## General information
The original database is from a mobile operator in France, which collects statistics (mobility analytics) using mobile data. The geographical space is the area of an international music festival aka "Festival International de Musique Universitaire" (FIMU), which happened in June 2017 in Belfort town France. The period of the analysis is 7 days including one day before the FIMU event (31/05/2017), the five days of the festival (1-5/06/2017), and one day after it (06/06/2017).
